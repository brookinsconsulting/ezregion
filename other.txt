xpublish:
Originaly written in 10/2001 durring the creation of xpublish.
xpublish a branch of ezpublish (1.x, 2.x) plus improvements and bug fixes. 

xpublish original features included:
- eztrade gpg credit card payment / order email encryption
- ezregion support to eZ address, eZ user & eZ trade for US Addresses & Transactions
- ezpublish intl/en_US/*.ini (International Text Langauge & Character Support for each module) to support for US Transactions

Issues like leaving simple bugs in the gpg order encryption (for credit cards) for eZTrade,
full and equal support for en_US to match en_GB the current default language in each module, 
or support for US States via eZRegion.

installation:

The packaged installed in eZ publish 2.2.2 should overright the 
eZAddress & eZ User module directories.

Replace them with the ones in the ezpublish/ directory.

If you wish to use eZ region 1.1.4 with an eZ publish version 
greater that 2.2.2, like say 2.2.7 just know that you may 
wish to install the code differences by hand to prevent the 
overighting of any ezpublish revisions. Bear with me as I 
package the next eZ region release 1.1.5 (based on 2.2.7).

The Code:

The code is written in ez's style. 

The code includes two features not implimented in user/ functions.

User Added. I included the sql field to allow for
future expansion in eZ region. I wanted to allow 
users to simply type in the name of their country
of origin apon request and have that field added 
dynamicly to the database.

Apon the User Added idea. I realized that the site
administrator may not apreaciete this feature because
it would give users the ablity to taint the existing 
accurate region list with bad data. In comes . . .

Removed. I included the sql field to allow admins (via the admin)
To edit the region and possibly disable (delete's not allowed due 
to eZ trade order data dependacy complication issues) the region 
from being displayed as an option in user/ functions.
